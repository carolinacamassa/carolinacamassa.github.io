A simple one-page personal website based on the Bootstrap CSS framework.


## Blog

My website also contains a tech blog that I started in March 2020. The blog is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. You can find the repo containing the published files for my blog [here](https://github.com/carolinacamassa/blog).
